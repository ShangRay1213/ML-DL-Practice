## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Datasets

All projects are implemented in **Jupyter Notebooks** and require a Python environment.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ShangRay1213/ML-DL-Practice.git](https://github.com/ShangRay1213/ML-DL-Practice.git)
    cd ML-DL-Practice
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (Recommended):**
    *(You may need to generate a `requirements.txt` file from your environment first.)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Note on Large Datasets:**
    * Datasets for projects like `Cats_dogs`, `Cifar-10`, and `IMDb` are **not included** here due to size constraints.
    * To run these notebooks, please manually download the original datasets (e.g., from Kaggle or public sources) and place them in the corresponding project folders as required by the code.
